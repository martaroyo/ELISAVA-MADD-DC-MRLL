# MADD-DC_MRLL_04  

A short introduction to data loading, reshaping, analysis and visualization in R for students at ELISAVA's Master in Data Design (MADD), as part of the Data Collection subject syllabus. 

This exercise uses a published dataset on indoor CO2 levels by Ennio Gambi (2020) in [Mendeley datasets](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/kn3x9rz3kd/1).   

The respository contains all the data and code to generate the base figures used in the infographic I have submitted to the challenge. Data analysis has been done with `R v4.0.3` in R studio, and the structure of the repository is the following:  

* `data/` contains all data used in the project, the original CO2 sensor data is called `dataset.csv`, while a mock metadata have been extracted from the dataset and saved under `MADD_DC_04_20250203_Metadata.txt`   
* `output/` contains the `.pdf` plot files saved during this exercise    

You can check the code for this exercise in the `.Rmd` file or explored the html rendered version downloading the [following file](https://martaroyo.github.io/ELISAVA-MADD-DC-MRLL-04/ELISAVA-MADD-DC-MRLL-04-20250203.html) and opening it in your browser.
